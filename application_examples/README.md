# 1 - Application examples - Introduction

The *Application examples* section of the **Machine Learning Core** repository contains examples of applications ready to be used on the ST MEMS devices, and are grouped by part number. 

Each folder (related to a sensor part number) contains sub-folders with examples of **Machine Learning Core** configurations. See a typical path below:

````Path
\lsm6dsox\Vibration monitoring\
````

Each example sub-folder contains:

- A **`README.md`** file,  with information about the specific application example.
- A **`.ucf`** file (Unico Configuration File), containing the device configuration generated by [**Unico GUI**]( https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/unico-gui.html ). This file can be loaded in different software tools ([Unico GUI](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/unico-gui.html) , [Unicleo GUI](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/unicleo-gui.html) , [AlgoBuilder GUI](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mems-and-sensors-software/inemo-engine-software-libraries/algobuilder.html), etc...) in combination with different hardware tools ([STEVAL-MKI109V3]( https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mems-motion-sensor-eval-boards/steval-mki109v3.html ), [STM32 Nucleo](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-nucleo-boards.html), [SensorTile.box](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mems-motion-sensor-eval-boards/steval-mksbox1v1.html), etc...) provided by ST. The following section describes how to use the file using the different tools.


- A **`.h`** file, containing the same information as the `.ucf` file, but in the format of a *C programming language header*  (also this file is generated by *Unico GUI*). Examples of  `.h` file integration in *C projects* are available at [platform independent drivers repository]( http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mems-and-sensors-software/drivers-for-mems/c-driver-mems.html ) for *STMicroelectronics* sensors.

## Run the example with *SensorTile.box* and *AlgoBuilder*

[AlgoBuilder](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mems-and-sensors-software/inemo-engine-software-libraries/algobuilder.html) is a software tool able to design a custom processing flow and to build the firmware for [STM32 Nucleo](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-mpu-eval-tools/stm32-nucleo-boards.html) boards coupled with the MEMS expansions, or for form-factor evaluation boards such as [SensorTile.box](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mems-motion-sensor-eval-boards/steval-mksbox1v1.html).

You will create a firmware project using *AlgoBuilder*, which can be configured to use [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-ides/stm32cubeide.html) to generate the binary file, [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stm32cubeprog.html#overview) to program the SensorTile.box device, and [Unicleo GUI](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/unicleo-gui.html) to display the output in real-time.

1. Configure *AlgoBuilder*: "File" -> "Application Settings", browse to select the path for Unicleo GUI, STM32CubeIDE, and STM32CubeProgrammer. 
2. Create a new design: "File" -> "New Design", browse and select the directory for the project, select the available IDE toolchain, select "SensorTile.box" or "SensorTile.box BLE" as target platform (the latter will support the use of a Bluetooth connection instead of the USB cable). 
3. Click and configure the default "Sensor Hub" block in the design to <u>use the timer as data rate control</u>, set the data rate and the full-scale of the sensors according to the example to be loaded. These settings should match the MLC settings.
4. Expand the "Sensor Hub" library, drag and drop the "FSM / MLC" block in the design, connect it to the "Sensor Hub" block, click and configure it for 0 Finite State Machine, 1 Decision Tree in the Machine Learning core, browse and select the corresponding `.ucf` file.
5. Optionally, from the "Sensor Hub" library, drag and drop the "Acceleration" block, connect it to the "Sensor Hub" block. Then, from the "Display" library, drag and drop the "Graph" block, click and configure it for the accelerometer data type, then connect it to the Acceleration block.
6. Then, from the "Display" library, drag and drop the "Value" block, click and configure it for the custom data type, set Number of Values to 1, set Window, Value, Unit names and  then connect it to the MLC output from FSM / MLC function block.
7. Generate the project: "Firmware" -> "Generate C code". Then build the binary: "Firmware" -> "Build Firmware". 
8. Program the target: put the *SensorTile.box* in **DFU mode**, "Tools" -> "Program Target". 
9. Open *Unicleo GUI*: "Tools" -> "Run Unicleo-GUI application", connect to the device, press Start to display the output in real-time.



## Run the example with *STWIN* and *HSDatalog*

[HSDatalog](  https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32-ode-function-pack-sw/fp-sns-datalog1.html  ) is a high speed data logging command line application for the [STWIN](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-stwinkt1.html) board.

*HSDatalog* also allows configuring ISM330DHCX Machine learning Core and reading the output of the selected algorithm. 

Here all the required steps to run a MLC example through *STWIN* and *HSDatalog*: 

1. Download the latest version of *HSDatalog*, contained in [FP-SNS-DATALOG1]( https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32-ode-function-pack-sw/fp-sns-datalog1.html  ) ( STM32Cube High Speed Datalog function pack for STWIN evaluation kits )

2. STWIN has to be programmed with **HSDatalog** firmware from *FP-SNS-DATALOG1* package (if already programmed you can skip the following two steps) 

   - Put the *STWIN* in **DFU mode** (Direct Firmware Upgrade): disconnect the battery and unplug the USB cable, press and hold the "USR" button, connect the USB cable then release the button while connecting the USB cable.

   - Run [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stm32cubeprog.html#overview), select "USB" from the pull-down menu on the right, then press "Connect". Click on the Menu button in the top-left corner. Optionally perform a full chip erase. Select "Erase & Programming", browse to select the **HSDatalog** binary (e.g. \FP-SNS-DATALOG1_V1.0.0\Projects\HSDatalog\Binary\HSDatalog.bin), set the address to 0x8000000, check "Run after Programming", then click "Start Programming".

3. Load the `.ucf` configuration to ISM330DHCX on *STWIN*, and acquire data logs to see MLC outputs. To do this, a terminal has to be opened, and the "cli_example" application (contained in \FP-SNS-DATALOG1_V1.0.0\Utilities\cli_example\bin) has to be called specifying the .ucf file name and (optionally) the period of the acquisition: 

   ````Path
   cli_example.exe -u file_name.ucf -t n_sec
   ````

   Further details on the high-speed data log function pack are available in the user manual [UM2688](  https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00685314-getting-started-with-the-stm32cube-high-speed-datalog-function-pack-for-stwin-evaluation-kits-stmicroelectronics.pdf  ).



## Run the example on a custom hardware using *C-programming*

A `.h` file is provided to easily include the MLC configuration in any C-programmable custom hardware.  

For using the *C header* files (`.h`), it is required: 

- A standard C language compiler for the target MCU
- A C library for the target MCU and the desired interface (i.e. SPI, I2C)

To run the example through the configuration provided in the `.h` file, it necessary to:

1. Include the C header file (`.h`) in the desired project 

2. Use the desired interface C library for the target *MCU* for writing the configuration registers array contained in the *C header* file (`.h`). 

Some examples of sensors integration are available at the [platform independent drivers repository]( http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mems-and-sensors-software/drivers-for-mems/c-driver-mems.html ) for *STMicroelectronics* sensors.
