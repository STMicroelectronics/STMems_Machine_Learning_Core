## 1 - Python scripts for MLC 

This folder contains Python scripts for the **Machine Learning Core** (MLC) of ST MEMS devices. 

The directory is organized as follows: 

- [Logs](./Logs) folder: contains data logs to easily run the scripts with the default configuration

- [Script](./Script) folder: contains the Python scripts for the MLC 

  The main script is available as a Jupyter notebook, with comments and instructions which describe how to customize the MLC configuration. Some Python modules (*.py* files) are included in the main script to perform dedicated tasks.

*Note*: **Python** version **3.8.8** has been used, and the [Unico GUI](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/unico-gui.html) software package version **9.14.6.0** has to be installed.

The Python scripts interact with an external application, which is run in the background to perform some tasks (e.g. *.arff* file generation and *.ucf*  file generation). 

The script performs all the MLC configuration steps, starting from the data logs to the device configuration (*.ucf* file generation). In the Jupyter notebook, after some general settings at the beginning, four main steps are available in four separate sections: 

1. Data pattern management and labeling
2. Filters/Features computation, *.arff* file generation
3. Decision tree generation
4. *.ucf* file generation

In the final part of the script, an additional section (optional) allows testing *.arff* files on decision trees.
